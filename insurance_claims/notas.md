# Data description

This data base was obtained from kagle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/litvinenko630/insurance-claims?resource=download)

# Introduction:
In the insurance industry, accurately predicting the likelihood of claims is essential for risk assessment and policy pricing. However, insurance claims datasets frequently suffer from class imbalance, where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual claims. This class imbalance poses challenges for predictive modeling, often leading to biased models favoring the majority class, resulting in subpar performance for the minority class, which is typically of greater interest.

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset utilized in this project comprises historical data on insurance claims, encompassing a variety of information about the policyholders, their demographics, past claim history, and other pertinent features. The dataset is structured to facilitate predictive modeling tasks aimed at accurately identifying the likelihood of future insurance claims.

# Key Features:

1.  Policyholder Information: This includes demographic details such as age, gender, occupation, marital status, and geographical location.
2.  Claim History: Information regarding past insurance claims, including claim amounts, types of claims (e.g., medical, automobile), frequency of claims, and claim durations.
3.  Policy Details: Details about the insurance policies held by the policyholders, such as coverage type, policy duration, premium amount, and deductibles.
4.  Risk Factors: Variables indicating potential risk factors associated with policyholders, such as credit score, driving record (for automobile insurance), health status (for medical insurance), and property characteristics (for home insurance).
5.  External Factors: Factors external to the policyholders that may influence claim likelihood, such as economic indicators, weather conditions, and regulatory changes.

# Objective:
The primary objective of utilizing this dataset is to develop robust predictive models capable of accurately assessing the likelihood of insurance claims. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as classification algorithms and ensemble methods, the aim is to mitigate the effects of class imbalance and produce models that demonstrate high predictive performance across both majority and minority classes.

# Application Areas:

1.  Risk Assessment: Assessing the risk associated with insuring a particular policyholder based on their characteristics and historical claim behavior.
2.  Policy Pricing: Determining appropriate premium amounts for insurance policies by estimating the expected claim frequency and severity.
3.  Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent insurance claims by detecting anomalous patterns in claim submissions and policyholder behavior.
4.  Customer Segmentation: Segmenting policyholders into distinct groups based on their risk profiles and insurance needs to tailor marketing strategies and policy offerings.
5.  
# Conclusion:
The insurance claims dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models aimed at enhancing risk management, policy pricing, and overall operational efficiency within the insurance industry. By addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance and leveraging the rich array of features available, organizations can gain valuable insights into insurance claim likelihood and make informed decisions to mitigate risk and optimize business outcomes.


# Feature	Description
-  **policy_id**	Unique identifier for the insurance policy.
-  **subscription_length**	The duration for which the insurance policy is active.
-  **customer_age**	Age of the insurance policyholder, which can influence the likelihood of claims.
-  **vehicle_age**	Age of the vehicle insured, which may affect the probability of claims due to factors like wear and tear.
-  **model**	The model of the vehicle, which could impact the claim frequency due to model-specific characteristics.
-  **fuel_type**	Type of fuel the vehicle uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG), which might influence the risk profile and claim likelihood.
-  **max_torque**, max_power	Engine performance characteristics that could relate to the vehicle’s mechanical condition and claim risks.
-  **engine_type**	The type of engine, which might have implications for maintenance and claim rates.
-  **displacement**, cylinder	Specifications related to the engine size and construction, affecting the vehicle’s performance and potentially its claim history.
-  **region_code**	The code representing the geographical region of the policyholder, as claim patterns can vary regionally.
-  **region_density**	Population density of the policyholder’s region, which could correlate with accident and claim frequencies.
-  **airbags**	The number of airbags in the vehicle, indicating safety level which can influence claim probability.
-  **is_esc** (Electronic Stability Control), is_adjustable_steering, is_tpms (Tire Pressure Monitoring System)	Features that enhance vehicle safety and could potentially reduce the likelihood of claims.
-  **is_parking_sensors**, is_parking_camera	Parking aids that might affect the probability of making a claim, especially in urban areas.
-  **rear_brakes_type**	Type of rear brakes, which could be related to the vehicle’s stopping capability and safety.
-  **Various** binary indicators (Yes/No) for specific vehicle amenities and safety features	Features like steering_type, turning_radius, length, width, gross_weight, etc., which together build a profile of -  the vehicle’s characteristics and its associated risk factors.
-  **claim_status**	Indicates whether a claim was made (1) or not (0), which is the dependent variable the model aims to predict.
